This repository contains a React + TypeScript project built with Vite.

### Coding style
- Use TypeScript (.tsx or .ts) and React functional components.
- Prefer 2 space indentation.
- Use semicolons at the end of statements.
- Use double quotes for strings.
- Tailwind CSS is configured in `tailwind.config.ts` and styles live in `src/index.css`.
- Keep components in `src/components`, pages in `src/pages` and utilities in `src/lib` or `src/hooks`.

### Development
- Install dependencies with `npm install` when required.
- Check linting with `npm run lint`.
- Build the project with `npm run build` (or `npm run build:dev` for development).
- Ensure `npm run lint` and `npm run build` succeed before committing.

### Commit style
- Use a short summary line in the imperative mood (e.g. `Add feature`), optionally followed by a blank line and more details.
- Keep the summary under ~72 characters.
